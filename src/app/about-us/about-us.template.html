		<h2>About Lost-Paws</h2>
		<p>Lost Paws is home to a community of pet lovers dedicated to helping lost pets reunite with their families. Lost Paws
			was created by a team of four web developers enrolled in the 21st cohort of the Deep Dive Coding bootcamp. We created
			Lost Paws because we believe that your pets are family, and if you ever loose your pet it should not be seen as a lost cause.</p>
